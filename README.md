The goal of this project was to decide if it would be worth changing my final drive gear in my 2001 2zz swapped MR-2. I was comparing a C56 final drive gear with a C60 final drive gear, both with the 6-speed C60 gearset. In the end, I was able to justify keeping the shorter gear ratios from the C60 final drive gear. 

Horsepower and Torque curves used in this simulation. Based on csv data from a dyno of my car:

This plot compares using two different final drive ratios in my car. The C60 and C56 are the two final drive gears I'm comparing. First is a plot of the speed over time of both gearsets. Next is a plot which shows the time differential in a drag race between cars using these two final drive gears.

The shorter ratios from the C60 results in a large time gained initially, which is important in AutoX racing where the lap always begins with a launch. Also, since the car would be in 2nd gear most of the time in AutoX runs, it's important to have better acceleration out of the corner from the shorter gearset. The drawback is that the top speed in 2nd gear is lower and shifting to 3rd gear is often awkward. However, even if the top speed in 2nd is reached, the time gained from the faster acceleration (of the C60) generally outweighs the time lost from the lower top speed.
